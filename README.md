## <ins>Project_Simple_SHELL
### 🧠 Description:
This project is an implementation of a minimalist shell for UNIX-like systems. It is a simple command-line interpreter, capable of reading user input, parsing it, and executing the requested commands. Like traditional shells such as bash or sh, this mini-shell provides a command-line interface, although its features are intentionally limited within the scope of this project.
### 🚀 Features:
- Display a prompt and wait for user input
- Parse and execute basic shell commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.)
- Built-in commands: exit, env
- Execution of programs in /bin/ (`/bin/ls`)
- Handling command paths via `PATH`
- Fork and execute commands via `execve`
- Environment variable access

### 📁 Structure_project:
```

```
## 💾 <ins>How_to_Compile:
You need gcc to compile this shell.
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
### 💻 How_to_Use:
1. Compile the program (as shown above)
2. Run the shell (shown below.):
```
./hsh
```
3. You'll see a prompt. Type commands like:
```
$ ls
$ pwd
$ echo "Hello, world"
$ exit
```
## ✅ <ins>Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
